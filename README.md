**So You Think You're a New Yorker Quiz**

Take this 8-question quiz and find out if you're truly a New Yorker or not. For entertainment purposes only.
Question ranges from facts to just plain fun. It's tailored towards NYC, and optimal for those with a sense of humor.  

This was a very personal and fun undertaking for me. As someone who was raised in NYC, I wanted to pay homage with a 
fun quiz. Many don't realize that calling oneself a "New Yorker" is a badge of honor. This was a fun way to test how much they really know 
 about the place they call home. So, I decided to participate in my own mini hackathon. 

What I Learned:
This was a huge learning and growth experience. I ran into a couple of challenges along the way, but I learned about state,
 capturing user responses in the URL, and generating forms without using a form library. 
 
 Project Challenges: 
* Have a total of 15 questions, but only deliver 8: I used an if statement to achieve this
* Those 8 questions needed to be randomized and must not repeat: I ended up using random.seed() for a pseudo random number generator
* The program had to remember the state as the user progressed from one page to the next
    * Note: I did not want log-in functionality 
    * Random.seed() was also used for this

Feedback has been very positive from quiz-takers! They've commented on the fun content and the smooth experience. 

Future To-Dos:
* Consider adding a page with answers
