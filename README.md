**So You Think You're a New Yorker Quiz**

Take this 8-question quiz and find out if you're truly a New Yorker or not. For entertainment purposes only.
Question ranges from facts to just plain fun. It's tailored towards NYC, and optimal for those with a sense of humor.  

This was a fun undertaking for me. I don't recall where the idea came from, but it became a mini hackathon for myself. 

What I Learned:
This was a huge learning experience. I ran into a couple of challenges along the way, but I learned about state,
 capturing user responses in the URL, and generating forms without using a form library. 
 
 Project Challenges: 
* Have a total of 15 questions, but only deliver 8: I used an if statement to achieve this
* Those 8 questions needed to be randomized and must not repeat: I ended up using random.seed() for a pseudo random number generator
* Needed to the program to remember the state as the user progressed from one page to the next: random.seed() was also used for this
